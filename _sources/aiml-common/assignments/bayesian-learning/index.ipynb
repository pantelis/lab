In essence at the very minimum you get a substantial perf improvement in performance and at the same time functionality that is very much needed for any differential learner to work (such as automatic differentiation). \n","\n","The assignment attempts to teach you a couple of things about Bayesian Linear Regression and allow you to develop the method from scratch using ... JAX. Please go over the sections 20.2.6-20.2.8 of [this textbook](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) to understand principles behind Bayesian Regression.    \n","\n","**Make sure you comply to the JAX API requirement. Make sure you type markdown cells or inline comments describing every line. The notebook must read like a tutorial. \n","\n","**For implementing this assignment you will use JAX from scratch without any other APIs but you are free to look at implementations of Bayesian Regression such as the [notebooks given in your course notes](https://github.com/ctgk/PRML/tree/main/notebooks).** \n","**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Generate and transform data  (20 points)\n","\n","Generate a sinusoidal dataset of $m$ data points [such as the one we have met in class](https://pantelis.github.io/data-science/aiml-common/lectures/regression/linear-regression/_index.html).
