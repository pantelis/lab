Lets assume that the employees that are posting are random logging in to that subreddit and that each post indicates whether the employee approves or not the job that the CEO is doing. Let $x_i$ be the binary random variable where $x_i=1$ indicates approval. You can assume that $x$ is distributed according to a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p=1/2$.\n",
