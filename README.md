## Building the book

If you'd like to develop and/or build the book, you should:

1. Clone this repository 
2. Launch the devcontainer via vscode dev container extension and run `poetry shell` to lauch the virtual environment `data-mining-book-py3.9`
3. (Optional) Edit the books source files located in the `data_mining/` directory
4. (Optional) Run `jupyter-book clean data_mining/` to remove any existing builds
5.  Run `sphinx-autobuild --host 0.0.0.0 data_mining _build/html` for interactive editing and liveview. 
6. (Optiona) Run `jupyter-book build data_mining/` for an offline build

A fully-rendered HTML version of the book will be built in `data_mining/_build/html/`.

## Hosting the book

Please see the [Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/publish/web.html) to discover options for deploying a book online using services such as GitHub, GitLab, or Netlify.

For GitHub and GitLab deployment specifically, the [cookiecutter-jupyter-book](https://github.com/executablebooks/cookiecutter-jupyter-book) includes templates for, and information about, optional continuous integration (CI) workflow files to help easily and automatically deploy books online with GitHub or GitLab. For example, if you chose `github` for the `include_ci` cookiecutter option, your book template was created with a GitHub actions workflow file that, once pushed to GitHub, automatically renders and pushes your book to the `gh-pages` branch of your repo and hosts it on GitHub Pages when a push or pull request is made to the main branch.
